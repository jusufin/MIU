This kitty is extremely friendly and likes people of all ages. She would be more content with constant freedom. Gem is a precious cat that longs for a home and family. All her shots are current and she is litterbox trained. We do not know how she would react to other pets in a home. She is an independent cat that dislikes shelter life.",

She was adopted as a kitten and recently lost her home due to her owner's allergies. Scarlet was not happy about this change in her lifestyle. She's a loving housecat that enjoys attention and petting and lots of lovin'. Scarlet has settled in, but hopefully her stay here will be brief! ",

Pookie is litterbox trained and oh so sweet. She loves people and all the attention she can solicit. She definitely does not like the other cats around her though. Pookie would prefer to be the only cat in the home! Pookie is so friendly and lovable that it is surprising she is still here. She is still playful and enjoys toys. Pookie is a fun little cat with tons of love and companionship to offer you.",
